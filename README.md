# Javascript - Functional programming

In programming there are many “paradigms”, which (put simply) define general ways of doing things in your code. In web development it's safe to say that the biggest player are Functional programming and Object-oriented programming, with the first getting more prominence in the current days, at least in the front-end side.

It is important to understand both, but we will take the Functional Programming route to dive deeper in this Guide. Do not stop yourself from going further and studying Object-oriented programming as well!

## Weather App

I created a responsive weather application, where I fetch data (weather forecats for cities for the actual day and for another five days ) from open weather. I am using API key in my .env file. I had to use some functions in order to get the forecats for five days and correct display of hours and date. You can just try it yourself, there is fifty cities saved in a json data and if the temperature is less than ten, the box with the one day forecats will turn blue.
